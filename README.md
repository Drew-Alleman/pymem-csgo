# pymem-csgo
A CS:GO Cheat Coded in Python with Glow and Radar Hacks

## Not Working?
If the game recently updated and hazedumper doesn't have the latest offsets yet replace the following code in ```cheats.py``` to use the latest blazedumper offsets.

### Old
```python
hazedumper = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frk1/hazedumper/master/csgo.json").json()
```
### New
```python
hazedumper = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akandesh/blazedumper/master/csgo.json").json()
```
